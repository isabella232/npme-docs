It may be possible to run npm Enterprise on other systems, but, at this time, no other systems are officially supported.We do our best to support as many systems as possible. If you have special requirements or feedback for other platforms, please reach out to us at support@npmjs.com. We'd love to work with you.You can also check for system issues on the npme-installer GitHub repo.Note on Disk SpaceThe amount of disk space needed is directly proportional to the number and size of packages your registry will need to host.For example, the full public registry hosts at least 300,000 packages with an average of 6 versions each, and this requires at least a terabyte of storage. Smaller registries, however, can get away with just a few gigabytes.Therefore, a server with 75 - 150 GB is a good choice for most registries.Please reserve at least 10 GB for OS resources and npm Enterprise appliance containers.Once installed, you can configure where registry data is stored on your server via the \"Storage\" paths on the \"Settings\" page of the admin web console (port 8800). For details on configuring your Enterprise instance, please see this page.Note on AWSWe have an AMI for npm Enterprise, and you should use it! Read more about that here.We recommend using an m3.large instance type.If extra storage is needed, you may want to attach an EBS volume to your EC2 instance and configure the \"Storage\" paths on your Enterprise appliance to use directories under the mount point.To open ports on your AWS EC2 instance, you can define a Security Group with the following Inbound settings:\n\nPort\nReason\n\n8080\nRegistry\n8081\nWebsite\n8800\nAdmin web console\n\n\n"},"up-and-running/platforms/":{"url":"up-and-running/platforms/","title":"Platform Tutorials","keywords":"","body":"Integrated Platform TutorialsHere's a list of tutorials that will walk you through creating\na VM and forwarding the necessary ports.Don't see your preferred platform here?

Just launch an instance, configure it using the npm Enterprise admin web UI, and you’re done: it’s a true point-and-click solution for sharing and managing private JavaScript packages within your company.Let’s take a quick look at the details.1. Find the AMI in your preferred AWS regionWe have AMIs for several AWS regions. When you launch a new instance in the AWS EC2 Console, find the right one by searching for the relevant AMI ID under the Community AMIs tab. Note that new AMI versions are published about every month and include the date of publication in the AMI name.Here’s a list of the AMI IDs by region:ap-northeast-2 (Seoul): ami-2d27f043\n\nap-southeast-2 (Sydney): ami-316c5452\n\neu-central-1 (Frankfurt): ami-81ec2aee\n\neu-west-1 (Ireland): ami-cddb80be\n\nus-east-1 (N. Virginia): ami-f1f3f4e6\n\nus-west-1 (N. California): ami-b1a5f2d1\n\nus-west-2 (Oregon): ami-6a39910a\n\nMake sure the AMI comes from owner 666882590071.If you don’t see your preferred region in the list above, contact our support team, and we’ll get one created for you!2. Launch itWhen you launch an instance of the AMI, you’ll need to:Choose an instance type: use m3.large or better\n\nEnter a storage size: must be at least 16 GB; we recommend 75-150 GB for typical installs\n\nSelect or create a security group: open ports 22 (ssh), 8080 (registry), 8081 (website), and 8800 (npm Enterprise admin UI)\n\nSelect or create a .pem key pair: this allows you to ssh into your server instance\n\nIt’s not necessary, but if you’d prefer to attach an EBS volume for registry data that is separate from the root volume, you can. However, the root EBS volume cannot be smaller than 16 GB.3. Configure and start the applianceYou don’t have to, but you can ssh into your EC2 instance to make sure it’s up and running. If you do, you should see a welcome message like the following:Open your favorite web browser, access your server on port 8800, and follow the prompts to configure and start your appliance.For more information on configuring npm Enterprise, see Server Configuration.That’s it! Once you’ve configured and started the appliance, your private npm registry and website are ready for use.

The AWSRegionToAMI property under Mappings would be the first thing to change as this provides a look up of the AMI Id for the distro image for each given region.After that, you'd need to revisit each of the shell scripts and change out distribution specifics such as the package manager and how to install and initialize Amazon's Cloud Formation initialiser.Below is the cloud formation template for npmE setup that you can use.npme-cloudformation.yamlAWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09\nDescription: AWS CloudFormation Template for npm enterprise instance.\nParameters:\n  SSHKeyName:\n    Description: Name of existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access.\n    Type: 'AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName'\n    ConstraintDescription: must be the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair.\n  SSHLocation:\n    Description: The IP address range that can be used to SSH to the EC2 instances\n    Type: String\n    MinLength: '9'\n    MaxLength: '18'\n    Default: 0.0.0.0/0\n    AllowedPattern: '(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})/(\\d{1,2})'\n    ConstraintDescription: must be a valid IP CIDR range of the form x.x.x.x/x.\n  AdminLocation:\n    Description: The IP address range that can be used to access the npme admin console\n    Type: String\n    MinLength: '9'\n    MaxLength: '18'\n    Default: 0.0.0.0/0\n    AllowedPattern: '(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})/(\\d{1,2})'\n    ConstraintDescription: must be a valid IP CIDR range of the form x.x.x.x/x.\n  RegistryLocation:\n    Description: The IP address range that can be used to access the npme admin console\n    Type: String\n    MinLength: '9'\n    MaxLength: '18'\n    Default: 0.0.0.0/0\n    AllowedPattern: '(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})\\.(\\d{1,3})/(\\d{1,2})'\n    ConstraintDescription: must be a valid IP CIDR range of the form x.x.x.x/x.\n  AdminPassword:\n    Description: npm enterprise admin console password.\n    Type: String\n    NoEcho: true\n  Branding:\n    Description: npm enterprise brand\n    Type: String\n    Default: \"\"\n  Environment:\n    Description: Environment settings to use for instance.\n    Type: String\n    Default: Production\n    AllowedValues:\n      -

This password is used by administrators to configure\nyour appliance.\n\nNext, a series of preflight checks will be run. These checks ensure that\nyou are running hardware that meets the requirements.\n\nThe Docker containers will now begin downloading for npm Enterprise, and\nyou can proceed to customizing your configuration.\n\nCustomizing Your ConfigurationThere are various dials and knobs that you can use to configure your\nnpm Enterprise appliance:Full URL of npm Enterprise registryThis field should contain the URL that your users will be using\nto access npm Enterprise. If you have placed a pretty DNS name on\nyour npm Enterprise appliance (perhaps using nginx, or a load-balancer)\nyou should place this DNS name here. Note: For installs and publications\nto work, this URL must be accessible.While you may choose to use the default registry URL\n(http://my-server:8080), setting an alternative port # will not result\nin the registry binding to an alternative port (it\n  always binds to :8080).Full URL of npm Enterprise websiteThe externally accessible URL of your npm Enterprise website.Your company nameThe company name that should be displayed on the npm Enterprise website.Secret used between servicesThe secret key used both between internal services and to connect\nupstream replication.Proxy URLIf your company connects to the external Internet through a proxy,\nset the URL here.StorageConfigure the storage for npm Enterprise's various data-files. Frequently you\nwill need to switch these paths to match a larger external drive that\nyou've mounted on your appliance.Upstream RegistryWhat upstream registry should npm Enterprise replicate packages from? This setting\ndefaults to the public registry (https://replicate.npmjs.com), but can be\nconfigured to replicate from other internal npm Enterprise registries for HA\ndeployments.Upstream URL: the registry to replicate from.\n\nUpstream secret: if connecting to another npm Enterprise registry, provide\nthe Secret used between services of the upstream server.\n\nPolicy to apply during replication: defaults to white-list, only replicating\nmodules added to your whitelist file (either by an administrator, or by the\nread-through-cache). To replicate an entire upstream registry, set this value\nto mirror.\n\nRead Through CacheBy default, rather than mirroring the entire >1TB npm registry,\nnpm Enterprise selectively caches packages the first time that you\ninstall them:npm i lodash --registry=http://my-private-registry:8080\nIf you would rather selectively whitelist packages from the public registry,\nor would prefer to mirror the entire registry, set this option to No.Reject UnauthorizedSet this option to No, if you would like to disable strict SSL checks\nfor operations performed by npm Enterprise.As an example, you might disable SSL checks if your upstream GitHub Enterprise\nserver is using a self-signed certificate.Custom DNSDefine up to three different custom DNS entries that will go into the\n/etc/hosts file of each npm Enterprise container. This is useful for working\naround networking issues where e.g. npm Enterprise is running on a different\nsubnet than your authentication provider or you need to be able to use a\nhostname without using the fully qualified domain name.Scoped CLI SearchBy default npm search does not return scoped packages (since this is\n  potentially a breach of private information). Enable this setting to\nstart returning scoped search results to the CLI.Note: you should only do this if your npm Enterprise appliance is\n  running behind a firewall.Auth Scoped InstallsShould a user be required to authenticate against the registry (e.g. npm login --registry=http://my-private-registry:8080) in order to npm install scoped packages (e.g. @company/foo)?This setting defaults to Yes to prevent anonymous users from installing private packages from your npm Enterprise registry. If your registry is running behind a firewall, you could set this to No to more easily share packages internally.Auth All InstallsShould a user be required to authenticate against the registry (e.g. npm login --registry=http://my-private-registry:8080) in order to npm install both scoped packages (e.g. @company/foo) and global packages (e.g. lodash)?This setting defaults to No so that global packages cached within your npm Enterprise registry may be installed without authentication, just like the public registry. If your registry is not running behind a firewall, you may want to set this to Yes.Auth WebsiteShould authentication be required to view the npm Enterprise website.Publication SettingsThe default All setting, allows both scoped and global modules to be\npublished to your npm Enterprise registry.By setting this value to Scoped, only scoped modules will be allowed to\nbe published to your registry.For replicas in HA deployments, you can set this value to Read Only to\ndisable all publications.AuthenticationRather than handling user accounts itself, npm Enterprise allows\nyou to connect to your company's existing authentication system.Read more about configuring authentication."},"up-and-running/auth/":{"url":"up-and-running/auth/","title":"Authentication","keywords":"","body":"AuthenticationRather than handling user accounts itself, npm Enterprise allows\nyou to connect to your company's existing authentication system.Currently we support:Open Authentication\n\nGitHub Enterprise\n\nBitbucket Cloud\n\nLDAP\n\nSAML\n\nOAuth 2, e.g. Google\n\nWriting Custom Authentication PluginsYou can also opt to write your own custom auth-plugin for npm Enterprise.Install your module on the host machine in the Miscellaneous data files storage directory (this defaults to /usr/local/lib/npme/data).

You can get this\nby running:[sudo] npm install npm -g\nPointing your client to the Enterprise registryOnce you have an up-to-date client, you can configure it to install from and\npublish to your private npm Enterprise registry.You can do this in one of two ways:Using Enterprise for private and public packages\n\nUsing Enterprise for private packages only\n\nRead about each option below.Option 1: Using Enterprise for private and public packagesIf you want all packages, whether they are under a scope or not, to be stored in\nyour private registry, then you should configure the npm client to use your\nprivate npm Enterprise appliance as the top level registry.To do this, first set your Enterprise registry as the CLI's default registry:npm config set registry http://myreg.mycompany.com:8080\nAnd then authenticate against your registry without a scope:npm login\nWhen clients are configured this way, they will always use your private npm\nEnterprise registry as their main registry. When using npm install, it will only\nlook in the private registry to find the package.To make sure your Enterprise instance supports this functionality, you should\nenable the \"Read Through Cache\" setting (enabled by default) in the server's\nadmin console (https://myreg.mycompany.com:8800/settings) so that public\npackages are automatically mirrored from the public registry and automatically\nadded to your registry's whitelist.Option 2: Using Enterprise for private packages onlyIf you want to default to using the public npm registry for most packages and\nonly use your private registry for packages under a particular scope, then you\ncan specify that the registry should only be used for that scope.To do so, use npm login with a registry and scope:npm login --registry=http://myreg.mycompany.com:8080 --scope=@myco\nAs a scope, it's recommended that you use your company name, e.g., @npm,\nor for large organizations a business unit within your company, e.g., @npm-cli.By running the npm login command  above, we tell the npm CLI that all\npackages using the @myco scope should be published to, and installed from,\nhttp://myreg.mycompany.com:8080 rather than https://registry.npmjs.org.example of package using the @myco scope:{\n  \"name\": \"@myco/credit-card-widget\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"example of scoped module\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\"\n}\nFor a more detailed discussion on the topic of scopes, visit the section of our\nFAQ on Scopes and Packages.Logging inThe npm login command will prompt you for your credentials. The credentials\nyou use should match the authentication strategy configured in the Settings of\nyour instance's admin console (https://myreg.mycompany.com:8800/settings).Note: by default Open authentication is enabled, this will allow you to\n test your npm Enterprise instance using any combination of username and password.For details on GitHub Enterprise integration, please see\nthis page.For details on configuring custom authentication, please see\nthis page.Single Sign-On Authentication (SAML, OAuth 2.0)When using a SSO provider for authentication you need to validate your session with SSO provider.The flag --auth-type allows you to delegate to a SSO provider during login.This feature requires a 4.4.x or newer version of the npm client.

In case of failure, reads/installs will still be available but writes/publishes will be unavailable until you can make a secondary instance the new primary by directing writes to it.To configure another instance as a replica, use the \"Upstream registry\" section of the Settings in the admin console:Set the Upstream URL to the registry URL (port 8080) of the primary instance\n\nSet the Upstream secret to the Secret used between services of the primary instance\n\nSet the Policy to apply during replication to mirror\n\nOptionally set the Publication Settings to Read Only to prevent accidental publishes to the replica\n\nPlease note that if you make these configuration changes after an instance has already been running, you should do one of the following on your replica instance:Run npme reset-follower\n\nStop the services/containers via admin console Dashboard, remove or truncate the sequence file in your replica instance (located in your configured \"Miscellaneous data files\" directory), and then start the services/containers.\n\nThis will ensure that your replica has the full set of package changes from the instance it's following.In this manner, you could set up multiple replicas of a single instance or daisy chain one replica behind another for redundancy. We do not limit the number of npm Enterprise instances you can run or the number of packages each instance holds - our license is only based on how many users benefit from your instances.Although it's not necessary, you may also wish to store manual snapshots for backup purposes in addition to running live replicas. The host directories you should snapshot are represented on the Settings page as the following:CouchDB storage path on host which defaults to /usr/local/lib/npme/couchdbCouchDB is used to hold package metadata for every package in your registry, including public and private packages. This is the directory that holds the critical db files representing this data.\nPackage storage path on host which defaults to /usr/local/lib/npme/packagesEach version of every package in your registry is stored as a tarball on the host file system. This is the root directory for all package tarballs.\nMiscellaneous data files which defaults to /usr/local/lib/npme/dataThe registry maintains some small files and runtime data to keep track of things like replication status and whitelist configuration. This is the directory that holds those files.\nIf all live replicas happen to fail, it is possible to recreate a warm instance by restoring snapshots of these directories after a new install. All other data can be rebuilt from the files in these key directories."},"tutorials/load-balancing-with-varnish.html":{"url":"tutorials/load-balancing-with-varnish.html","title":"Load balancing with Varnish","keywords":"","body":"Load balancing with VarnishIf you are using npm Enterprise and want to apply Varnish as a solution for load balancing then follow the steps below.Install and configure nginx.Configure nginx\n\nIncrease limits\n\n\nInstall and configure varnish.\nOpen *.vcl file (by default it is default.vcl).Varnish has a concept of \"backend\" servers.

How many scopes can I use?\n\nHow should I choose my scope?\n\nIf I publish a package to my npm Enterprise registry, will it be published privately on the public registry too?\n\n\nWhat is npm Enterprise made of?npme consists of Docker, Replicated, the npme appliance, and the npme installer bin.Docker is used to run Replicated and the npme appliance.Replicated is npme's orchestration software and admin console. It consists of its own Docker images/containers and integration with the underlying operating system. The admin console binds to port :8800 and uses an SSL/TLS cert separate from the npme appliance. Access the admin console using your favorite browser to configure and manage your npme instance.The npme appliance is a suite of Docker images/containers that make up the private npm registry and website. The registry binds to port :8080 and the website binds to port :8081 on your host. Each instance of the appliance maintains its own databases as Docker containers, storing their data in configurable directories on the host file system. The npme appliance is configured and managed by the admin console. The appliance does not use any SSL/TLS certificate, but the registry and website can be fronted with a load balancer, web server, or reverse proxy that terminates SSL/TLS. See Terminating SSL with NGINX for an example.The npme bin is a CLI app distributed as a public npm package. It is used as a one-step installer for Docker and Replicated, and after installation it provides several administrative commands for adding or configuring functionality for your npme instance. In order to use it, you must have Node and npm installed on your host.The last piece to the puzzle is npm itself. The same CLI client you use to install packages from the public registry can be used to publish and install private packages from npm Enterprise. Read more about in Common Workflows.How do I upgrade npm Enterprise?The answer depends on which part of npme you're talking about.Upgrading the appliance (registry and website)This is the most common type of upgrade, and it can be done from the admin console web UI (port :8800). Either click the \"Check Now\" button in the top-center panel of the Dashboard page (/dashboard) or go to the Releases page (/releases). If a new version is available, it will be displayed with an option to install it - just click the button!Upgrading to a new appliance version will first download the necessary Docker images and then restart the appliance. Downtime will be incurred while the appliance is restarted and generally takes less than a minute.It's probably a good idea to check for updates every few weeks.\nUpgrading the npme binYou can upgrade the npme installer bin by SSH'ing into your server and simply running: sudo npm i -g --ignore-scripts npme\nThis will not affect the running appliance and does not incur any downtime.\nUpgrading Replicated with or without DockerThe method you use to upgrade Replicated (npme's orchestration software and admin console) depends on the current version your instance is running.To determine the Replicated version, SSH into your host and run replicated --version.If you're running a version less than 2.0.0, you need to migrate to version 2 first. Run this and answer any prompts: curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/migrate-v2 | sudo bash\nIf you're running a version greater than 2.0.0, you can either upgrade Replicated and Docker together using the npme installer (run the following and answer any prompts): sudo npm i npme -g --unsafe\nOr you can upgrade just Replicated by running this and answering any prompts: curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com/docker | sudo bash no-docker\nIt's generally a good idea to upgrade Replicated with Docker to make sure your system is running the best compatible version of Docker for npme.Note that all of these options incur downtime for your npme instance.\nWhat is npmo/npm On-Site, and how is it related to npme/npm Enterprise?The first version of npm Enterprise did not use Docker or Replicated, but it only supported a small range of platforms. Around August 2015, the product was refactored to leverage Replicated and Docker, significantly expanding the range of supported platforms, and was soon renamed to npm On-Site. Over time we discovered the On-Site name was confusing, and so in April 2016 we rebranded npm On-Site back to npm Enterprise.npm On-Site is literally the same product as npm Enterprise, just an older version. Similarly, the npmo bin was renamed to npme and has been deprecated.If you're currently running npm On-Site, please use the How do I upgrade npm Enterprise? answer to upgrade to npm Enterprise, and make sure to migrate Replicated to version 2. You should also replace the npmo bin on your host with npme via the following:sudo npm uninstall -g npmo\nsudo npm i -g --ignore-scripts npme\nHow do I replicate between two npm Enterprise instances?It's good practice to setup a second npm Enterprise as a replica of your primary npm Enterprise\nserver. This gives you a hot spare to fallback to in the case of failure.Setting up a replica is easy:on your primary server copy the values of Full URL of npm Enterprise registry, and\nSecret used between services (replication connects to the registry component\n of npm Enterprise, which defaults to running on :8080).\n\nprovision the secondary server and ensure that publication and installation is working\nappropriately.\n\nOptionally, set Publication Settings to Read Only on the secondary server (this\nwill prevent users form accidentally publishing packages to it).\n\non the secondary server:set Upstream URL to the value of Full URL of npm Enterprise registry on the primary.\n\nset Upstream secret to the value of Secret used between services on the primary.\n\nset Policy to apply during replication to mirror on the secondary server.\n\n\nssh into the secondary server, and run npme reset-follower.\nThat's all there is to it, wait a few minutes and the secondary should be synced with the\nprimary server.For more details, see replication for Backups and HA.What should I do if npm Enterprise binds to the wrong IP address?In rare situations, npm Enterprise may bind to the wrong Daemon Address\nfor the cluster of services that it provisions. To fix this, manually configure\nthe IP address:On Centos/RHELedit /etc/sysconfig/replicated, set PRIVATE_ADDRESS to the appropriate value.\n\nedit /etc/sysconfig/replicated-operator, set PRIVATE_ADDRESS to the appropriate value.\n\nsudo systemctl restart replicated replicated-operator, to reload the environment.\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debianedit /etc/default/replicated, set PRIVATE_ADDRESS to the appropriate value.\n\nedit /etc/default/replicated-operator, set PRIVATE_ADDRESS to the appropriate value.\n\nsudo service replicated stop && sudo service replicated-operator stop && sudo service replicated start && sudo service replicated-operator start, to reload the environment.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a devicemapper warning?Running devicemapper in loopback mode is discouraged for production.\nIt has known performance problems and a different storage driver should be used. \nSee devicemapper performance considerations \nand selecting a storage driver to understand the available storage drivers and limitations.To find out which storage driver is set on the daemon, use the docker info command:$ docker infoYou can set the storage driver by passing the —-storage-driver= option to the dockerd command line.$ dockerd --storage-driver=overlay &Alternatively, you can force the Docker daemon to automatically start with the overlay/overlay2 driver by editing the Docker config file and adding the —-storage-driver=overlay flag to the DOCKER_OPTS line.Your choice of storage driver can affect the performance of your npm Enterprise server. \nSo it’s important to understand the different storage driver options available and select the right one for your application.We recommend that you use the overlay driver, rather than devicemapper; for help configuring this please see the following tutorialWhy use npm Enterprise?npm Enterprise is single tenant vs. multi tenant -- which is important for companies with advanced compliance needs. npm Enterprise also allows you to have any number of scopes, and provides its own website, which can be useful for large organizations.\nnpm Enterprise allows you to run npm’s infrastructure behind your company’s firewall.\nIntegration with the Node Security Platform provides package-level analysis to assist enterprise customers with security risk mitigation.Read more about it on our blog and this Node Security Platform article..\nSignificantly improve the efficiency of your development process making it easier to share documentation and code, streamline your build process, and breakup your monolithic code-bases into individual packages that are easier to maintain.\nControl access to packages and the website via the following supported authentication types:GitHub Enterprise\n\nBitbucket Cloud\n\nLDAP\n\nSAML\n\nOAuth 2, e.g. Google\n\nOptionally, develop your own custom auth-plugin for advanced cases where a supported option is unavailable.\nWhat should I do with git dependencies on closed networks?If you are installing a package that has a git URL as a dependency, npm will fetch that package from the remote git repository itself. npm supports both git and HTTP URL formats, so we will need to work around this in our private registry.\"dependencies\" : {\n  \"name1\" : \"git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish\",\n  \"name2\" : \"git://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish\"\n}\nWhen you are installing the package in the closed network where a dependency references a git url rather than a package name, you will be unable to install the dependency since it references an external network address.Publishing the git dependency to your private repoIn this situation, one approach you can take is to download a tarball version of the package and republish it to your private registry.You can download a tarball version of the package from GitHub using: wget -L https://github.com/user-or-org/repo/archive/master.tar.gz\nReplace user-or-org and repo accordingly.To publish the tarball to your private registry simply follow the steps listed below:tar -xvzf package.tar.gz\n\ncd package\n\nnpm publish --registry=http://your-private-registry:8080 --scope=@your-scope\n\nUpdating packages to reference the new dependencyAfter publishing the git dependency to your private repo you need to update the packages to reference the new dependency.\"dependencies\" : {\n  \"@your-scope/package-name\" : \"latest version\"\n}\nPlease note that, since it will often be a dependency of a dependency that has the git dependency, it will likely be necessary to both publish the git dependency and the dependency requiring it. A good best practice is to publish these new versions with a scope (@your-scope/request);We have a tool for simplifying this process: https://www.npmjs.com/package/scope-itHow do I update my npm Enterprise license?You can update npm Enterprise license by following the steps below:Run npme update-license on your npm Enterprise server.\nIt will prompt you for billing email, enter your registered billing email.\nThen it will prompt you for license key, enter your license key.\nYou can get a license key by purchasing an npm Enterprise license on our license pageWhat should I do if ssl problem occurs with npme over https?When using a custom certificate for your npme registry, you might get an error related to the SSL certificate when logging in or publishing a package even though the browser does not display errors when viewing the npme registry site. This is because node's certificate validation is strict and doesn't allow for things like self-signed certificates by default.\nTo fix your issue temporarily you can provide --strict-ssl=false during login or you can add it to your ~/.npmrc file\nnpm config set strict-ssl=false.For a permanent fix, you can point npm to a cafile.npm config set cafile /path/to/cert.pem\nYou can also configure ca string(s) directly.npm config set ca \"cert string\"`\nca can be an array of cert strings too. In your .npmrc:ca[ ]=\"cert 1 base64 string\"\nca[ ]=\"cert 2 base64 string\"\nThe npm config commands above will persist the relevant config items to your ~/.npmrc file:cafile=/path/to/cert.pem\nThe above cafile setting will override the default \"real world\" certificate authority lookups that npm uses. If you try and use any public npm registries via https that aren't signed by your CA certificate, you will get errors.If you need to support both public https npm registries as well as your own, you could use curl's Mozilla based CA bundle and append your CA cert to the cacert.pem file.What's the difference between a scoped package and an unscoped package?A scoped package has a scope (or namespace), which begins with an @ symbol and is followed by a /, in the package name, e.g. @scope/foo. An unscoped package has no scope in the package name, e.g. foo. The scope is a permanent part of the package's name and identity, used in package.json and also in require() or import statements in code.Technically, the only difference is the presence of a scope in the package name. Semantically, however, a scoped package is private by default. For this reason, we highly recommend that you use a scope for any and all packages that you do not want to publish publicly.Does using a scope make packages private automatically?Yes, because a scoped package is only made public if published using npm publish --access public (or subsequently modified via npm access public). For this reason, we highly recommend that you use a scope for any and all private packages.Do I have to use a scope for the packages I publish to npme?Technically no. There are a couple ways you can configure your npm client (or even an individual package) to point to your private registry without using a scope, but we highly recommend using a scope for all private packages to avoid unintentionally publishing your private package to the public registry, based on the following facts:The npm CLI client treats scoped packages as private by default.\n\nYou cannot accidentally publish a scoped package to the public registry unless you have access to that scope in the public registry.\n\nThere are valid workflows which publish prerelease versions of a package to a private npm Enterprise registry as a precursor to publishing a release version publicly on the public registry, but this is not a typical use-case.For more info on scopes, see the next question.Am I assigned a scope for npm Enterprise? How many scopes can I use?Unlike orgs or private packages on the public registry, you are not assigned a scope to use for private packages you publish to npm Enterprise. You are free to use any scope name that you wish, but to avoid namespace collisions with public scoped packages, you should try to use a scope that identifies your company/organization and is unique on the public registry. This will also make it easier to switch to npm's hosted orgs solution (where your private packages are hosted privately on the public registry), if you ever wish to do so. But it's your choice!You are allowed to use as many scopes as you like with npm Enterprise. You could use different scopes for different teams or projects within your organization, or use one scope for all packages. It's up to you!How should I choose my scope?It's recommended that you use your company name, e.g., @npm,\nor for large organizations a business unit within your company, e.g., @npm-cli. There's\nno limit on the number of scopes that you can use in npm Enterprise.If I publish a package to my npm Enterprise registry, will it be published privately on the public registry too?No. Packages published to npm Enterprise are not published to an upstream registry, particularly not the public registry. One of the main reasons to use npm Enterprise is that you maintain complete control over the packages that you publish - they belong to you and they live only on your server(s). Access to packages published to npm Enterprise is defined by your configured authentication/authorization provider, which is controlled by you or your organization. The access control used by the public registry is different and completely separate."},"troubleshooting/replication.html":{"url":"troubleshooting/replication.html","title":"A Package Failed to Replicate","keywords":"","body":"A Package Failed to ReplicateOccasionally, due to networking issues, npm Enterprise will\nfail to replicate a version of a package that has been added to your mirror.
